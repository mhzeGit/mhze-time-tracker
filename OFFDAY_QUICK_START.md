# Off-Day Feature - Quick Start Guide

## What is an Off-Day Type?

An "Off-Day" type is a special type for tracking days when you're not working (holidays, time off, vacation, etc.). Unlike regular task types, off-days appear in your charts but are **excluded from all statistics**.

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create an Off-Day Type
- Click **"Add Type"** button
- Enter name: "Holiday" (or "Vacation", "Day Off", etc.)
- Pick a color (optional but recommended for visual distinction)
- ☑️ **CHECK the "Mark as 'Off Day' type" checkbox**
- Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Add Off-Day Entries
- Use the entry form to add entries just like normal
- Select your off-day type (e.g., "Holiday")
- Set the date and time
- Click **"Add Entry"**

### Step 3: Watch Your Statistics Improve
Your statistics will now accurately reflect only your working days:
- Daily average won't include holiday hours
- Weekly average won't include holiday hours
- Total time won't include holiday hours
- Off-day entries still show in the chart for reference

## Visual Impact

### Before Off-Day Feature
- 5 working days: 50 hours
- 5 holiday days: 0 hours
- **Daily Average: 10 hours** ❌ (Misleading! Includes 0-hour days)

### After Off-Day Feature (with Holiday type)
- 5 working days: 50 hours
- 5 holiday days: marked as "Off-Day" type
- **Daily Average: 10 hours** ✅ (Accurate! Only counts working days)
- **Chart Still Shows**: The off-days appear in the bar chart for visual reference

## Pro Tips

1. **Color Coding**: Use a distinct color for off-days (e.g., gray or a muted color)
2. **Naming**: Be consistent - use "Holiday", "Vacation", "Off", etc.
3. **Multiple Off-Day Types**: You can create different off-day types if needed (e.g., "Vacation", "Sick Leave", "Personal Day")
4. **Filtering**: Off-day entries respect all existing filters and sorting
5. **Charts**: Off-days still appear in charts - just not in statistics

## FAQ

**Q: Can I convert an existing type to an off-day type?**
A: Yes! Edit the type, check the off-day checkbox, and save. Existing entries with that type will be excluded from statistics going forward.

**Q: Will off-day entries be deleted?**
A: No! Off-day entries are never deleted. They just don't count toward statistics.

**Q: Can I have multiple off-day types?**
A: Yes! You can create multiple types marked as off-days (e.g., "Vacation", "Sick", "Weekend").

**Q: Will this affect my saved data?**
A: No! The feature is fully backward compatible. Your existing data remains unchanged.

**Q: Can I still see off-day entries in the chart?**
A: Yes! That's the whole point. Off-days show in the chart but are excluded from statistics.

## Need to Revert?

If you want to make an off-day type a regular type again:
1. Edit the type
2. Uncheck the "Mark as 'Off Day' type" checkbox
3. Click "Save"

All entries with that type will now be included in statistics again.
